|    1 |        1 | Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Whisk the water and oil together in a small bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and pour in the wet. Stir just until blended; mixture will be lumpy |
|    1 |        2 | Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.     |

|    5 |        2 | Cut the tops off of the tomatoes and scoop out their insides; chill until the shrimp mixture is well chilled.                                                                                                                             |

|    6 |        1 | Stir together olive oil, garlic, and salt; toss with tomatoes, and allow to stand for 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).                                                                                          |
